The three text files (`column1.txt`, `column2.txt`, `column3.txt`) contain the insults from the three columns as shown above.
The program then takes each text file and imports it into an array where a random number is generated to be the index of the array and a unique insult is generated. 

Try it for youself! Just compile and run `InsultGenerator.java`!
